# vigenere_cipher
encrypt and decrypt a message


I chose to use the Vigenere Cipher because it is the most secure cipher. There are over 600 possibilities per encrypted letter and the chances of repeated charecters is easily avoided, making the encrypted message hard to break. I decided to design a very basic front end in HTML to show your original message, choose which Keyword you would like to use and then it shows the encrypted message to show that the Javascript coding works. Unfortunately I coulnt seem to get the special charcters part working and therefore the code does not work if you use spaces between words. With more time I feel that I could have got this working.

I coded in Javascript because this is the language I am most proficient in.
